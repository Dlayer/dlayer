		<p>The Image library is the base for all image management, the 
			Image library is site wide.</p>
		
		<p>Image assets can be categorised using any number of categories and 
			sub categories, the only hard rules being that a Misc. sub 
			category is automatically created when a new category is added and a 
			backgrounds category will be created on first visit to the Image 
			library.</p>
			
		<p>Anytime an image is manipulated using a tool a new version is 
			created and the tool used to create the new version is recorded. 
			All older versions of images are always accessible, recoverable 
			and usable by of the tools in the designers. A background tool 
			can use the cropped version of an original image without 
			affecting the original version of the image.</p>
			
		<p>When you use an image in the designers the system automatically 
			creates a new version of the image which is then assigned to the 
			content item, although a new version is created from your 
			perspective these are really shallow copies (links) to the 
			selected image version.</p>
			
		<p>The Image library includes all the standard adjustment and 
			manipulation tools, for example cropping and resizing.</p>
			
		<p>When you neec to choose an image you will be presented with an 
			Image picker that allows you to filter down your selection by 
			category, subcategory, image and then version.</p>
