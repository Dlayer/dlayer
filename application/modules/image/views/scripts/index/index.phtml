		<h3>Welcome to the Image library</h3>
		
		<p>The Image library is where all media management is done, the Image 
			library is a site wide feature that is exposed to the rest of the 
			system via the image picker.</p>
		
		<p>You can add images to templates, widgets, content pages, forms and 
			many other items, all of the designers will include tools or sub 
			tools that use images from the Image library.</p>
		
		<p class="dev-note bg-info">The Image library currently sits somewhere 
			between preview and alpha status, you can upload images for use 
			in other designers but I havenâ€™t yet included any manipulation 
			tools.</p>
