<h2>Split block horizontally</h2>

<p>This tool allows you to split the selected template block up into two or 
more rows, you can do this by choosing where to split the block or by using 
one of the 'Quick' options which splits the block into equivalent sized 
rows.</p>

<p>In both cases you can modify the sizes of the new rows after you have 
split the template block.</p>
