	<h3>Help <small>Add a heading content item to the content page</small></h3>	
	
	<p>This tool allows you to add a heading content item to the content page, 
		to add a heading content item you need to define the heading, an 
		optional sub heading, select the heading type to use and also a name 
		by which to identify it later, the name will only be visible to you 
		within Dlayer.</p>
	
	<p>A heading content item will automatically be sized to span the entire 
		width of the content row.</p>
	
	<p>At any time, the size and position of the heading content item can be 
		managed via the size and position tab when the tool is in edit mode, 
		in edit mode you will also get access to all the other sub tools.</p>
	
	<p>The styling options used by the six heading types are defined in the 
		Content manager settings section. Although you can override any of 
		the styling options on a case by case basis, it makes sense, where 
		possible, to make your changes within the 
		<a href="/content/settings/headings">settings section</a> to ensure 
		that your headings remain consistent across your web site.</p>
