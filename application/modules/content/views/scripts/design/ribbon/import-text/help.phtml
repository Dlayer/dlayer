	<h3>Help <small>Add a text content item to the content page using 
		existing content.</small></h3>
		
	<p>This tools allows you to create a new text content using data from an 
		existing or deleted text content item. Simply select the existing 
		content that you would like to import, the text field will be populated 
		with your chosen text, you are free to modify any of the imported 
		values if required.</p>
	
	<p>The initial size of the newly inserted text content item depends upon 
		whether or not there are any other content items in the content row, 
		Dlayer will attempt to predict a sensible size for you based on the 
		size of any sibling content items and any remaining space, it will 
		attempt to size the text content item to fill all the remaining space. 
		If Dlayer deems that there is not enough remaining space in the content 
		row it will set a sensible default, for text content items the default 
		is 12, the text content item will automatically be sized to span the 
		entire width of the content row. If the text content item is the only 
		item in the content row the same rule will be applied.</p>
	
	<p>Once created the imported content item will behave as a standard text 
		content item.</p>
