	<h3>Help <small>Create a new text content item</small></h3>
	
	<p>This tool allows you to add or edit a text content item, to add a 
		text content item you need to define the text and an internal name 
		to identity the text by.</p>
	
	<p>The initial size of a text content item depends on whether or not 
		there are other content items in the content row, if the text item 
		is the only item in the  row the content will span the entire row, 
		otherwise it will span all the remaining space. There is a minimum 
		suggested width, if the content item will be smaller than this value 
		the content item will drop down below all the other content and fill 
		the entire row, the minimum suggested value is just a guide, it can 
		be overridden manually.</p>
	
	<p>The width and position of the text content item can be managed via the 
		size and position tab when you are in edit mode, in edit mode you 
		will have access to all the sub tools.</p>
