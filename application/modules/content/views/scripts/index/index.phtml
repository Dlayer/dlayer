		<p>Web sites are a collection of linked web pages, your create your 
			pages in the Content manager, specifically by placing content 
			items onto pages. Content is a generic term, a content item 
			could be a single image, a text block, a form or a widget in the 
			form of an image gallery.</p>
		
		<p>A new content page is created from a template, the content areas 
			are defined by the template and control the general layout of the 
			page, you can also create a new content page by copying an 
			existing one or modifying one of the provided samples.</p>
		
		<p>To add content you need to select a content area and then add a 
			content row, the row doesn't appear to the user, it is just a 
			guide to allow you to align multiple content items up if 
			required. A content item can then be added to the page, the 
			options that need to be defined depend on the content item, 
			where possible Dlayer will provide sensible default values, 
			one constant setting will be the width of the item, this is how 
			much of the row you would like the content item to span, there 
			can be twelve columns in each row and you can set any value 
			between one and twelve.</p>
		
		<p>There are two types of content items, dynamic content and 
			standard content, forms and widgets are dynamic content items, 
			everything else is classed as a standard content item. Content 
			items are attached by reference so if you re-use a piece of 
			content you will only need to update it in one location.</p>
		
		<p>Changes to dynamic content items need to be made within the 
			relevant designer, you can however at any point jump to the 
			relevant designer to make your changes and return easily to the 
			Content manager where your current state will have been 
			maintained.</p>
		
		<p>There are no artificial limits on the number of content pages 
			that can be created or the number of content items that can be 
			attached to a page, you have full control. </p>
		
		<p class="dev-note bg-info">The tools in the Content manager are not 
			as per my final design, as it stands today when adding or editing 
			content everything needs to be defined in the side panel, as 
			development continues everything will move closer to my final 
			design where the side panel will only be for controlling data 
			that cannot easily be managed directly, 'live', in the view.</p>
		
		<p>Select a content page from the list below, once a content page 
			has been selected you can continue to work on it in the Content 
			manager, edit the base details or copy the page to create a 
			brand new content page.</p>
