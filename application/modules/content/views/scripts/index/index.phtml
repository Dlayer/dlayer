		<h1>Content manager <small>Content page management</small></h1>
		
		<h3>Welcome to the Content manager</h3>
		
		<p>Websites are essentially a collection of content pages consisting 
			of content items. Content is a generic term, a content item could 
			be a single image, text block, form, poll or a widget in the form 
			of an image gallery, blog or simply a twitter feed.</p>
		
		<p>A content page is created from a template, the content areas 
			defined in the template block out the general layout of a page, 
			examples being the header, footer, side bar and main content area.</p>
		
		<p>There are two base types for content items, standard and dynamic. 
			Forms, polls and widgets are dynamic content items, everything 
			else is a standard content item, all content items are attached 
			by reference so there is never any duplication.</p>
		
		<p>To create a content item you select the content area you want to 
			work in, add a content row and then choose the content type you 
			want to create, content rows act as invisible guides to ease 
			with lining up content items. To edit an existing content items 
			you simply select the content area, the content row and then 
			finally the content item itself.</p>
		
		<p>There are no artificial limits to the number or content pages you 
			can create or the number of content items that can be assigned to 
			either a page or content area, you have full control over 
			everything.</p>
		
		<p class="dev-note bg-warning">The tools in the Content manger are 
			not at per my final design, they are a stepping stone. As it 
			stands today when adding or editing content all data is managed 
			in the side panel, as development continues the tools will be 
			updated to allow more data to be managed directly within the 
			design view.</p>
			
		<h2>Content pages <small>All your content pages</small></h2>
		
		<p>Select a content page from the list below, once selected you can 
			manage its content, edit the base details or copy it to create a 
			brand new content page.</p>
