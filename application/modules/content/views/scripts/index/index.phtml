    <h1>Content manager</h1>
    
    <h2>Web site: <?php echo $this->escape($this->site['name']); ?></h2>
    
    <p>Using the content manager you can either create new pages for your 
    web site or manage existing content, content is anything from text and 
    images all the way up forms and widgets.</p>
    
    <p>You create a content page by either starting from one of your 
    templates or copying an exists content page.</p>
    
    <p>You don't manage the relationship between pages here, that is done in 
    the we bsite manager, the content manager is purely for adding content and 
    editing existing content.</p>
    
    <p><em>The tools as they currently exist in the content manager are not 
    how I plan on the final content tools to work. In a later release, 
    hopefully third or fourth the content tools will be updated, the ribbon 
    will contain the options to control the container, its size, padding etc, 
    the text will be live edited directly in the design.</em></p>
    
    <p>Select a page from the list below, once a page has been activated you 
    can continue designing it, edit it or copy the structure and content to 
    create a new page.</p>
