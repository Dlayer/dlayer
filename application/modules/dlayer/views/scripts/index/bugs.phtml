		<h1>Bugs and issues <small>The nasty critters that bring down the 
			quality of my app.</small></h1>
		
		<p>Dlayer is an alpha level product, I'm attempting to ensure that 
			nothing slips through testing but obviously there are going to be 
			bugs and during development I will create several issues.</p>
			
		<p>Bugs occur for a number of reasons, I might have made a 
			mistake, I might have failed to account for every possibility 
			with a feature or I might not yet have finished a feature leaving it 
			broken knowing that I will be going back to rework on it.</p>
			
		<p>Issues are things that I need to take another look at, as the app 
			evolves I might work out a new way of doing something or a feature 
			I created in the past might not be very efficient, issues are how 
			I correct them.</p>
			
		<p class="dev-note bg-info">I don't bother listing bugs here that are 
			found and fixed within one version, they will however be listed in 
			the development log, this is for bugs that stick around.
			
			<br /><br />
		
			If you find any bugs that aren't listed 
			here please let me know via my blog or email me at 
			dean (at) g3d-development (dot) com.</p>
			
		<h2>Open bugs and issues <small>Still to fix</small></h2>
		
		<!--<p>There are currently no open bugs, this isn't because I am 
			awesome, I've just been through a large refocus and to date 
			haven't spotted any bugs.</p>-->
			
		<h4><span class="label label-danger">Bug</span> Import tools<small> Designer: Content manager - Filed: 
			26th March 2015</small></h4>
			
		<p>Import tools should not remain selected after adding a content 
			item, the corresponding standard tool should be enabled, for 
			example after importing a text item the text tool should be 
			activated.</p>
			
		<h4><span class="label label-warning">Issue</span> Form builder tools<small> Designer: Form builder - Filed: 
			3rd June 2015</small></h4>
			
		<p>The Form builder tools are not very elegant, they were the first 
			tools created, they need to borrow from the Content manager tools. 
			The preset tools are complicated without any real justification, 
			there is duplication and the way values are returned from the tools 
			currently is a hack.</p>
			
		<h2>Closed bugs and issues<small> Either squished or no longer 
			an issue</small></h2>
		
		<!--<p>The bugs listed below are all closed, they have either been fixed 
			or are no longer applicable due to a change in how Dlayer 
			works.</p>-->
			
		<h4><span class="label label-danger"><s>Bug</s></span> Selectors <small>Designer: Content manager - 
			Filed: 2nd March 2015 - Closed: 27th March 2015</small></h4>
		
		<p>Two colours are used when selecting items in the content manager, 
			yellow for a selected item and blue for a selectable child item 
			on hover.</p>
			
		<p>When a background colour is defined for a content container or 
			content item the selector function doesn't override the items 
			background colour meaning it can be difficult to work out which 
			item or type of item is being selected.</p>
			
		<p class="dev-note bg-success">Updated selectors to clear background 
			colours for child items, helps with selecting areas, content rows 
			and content items.</p>
			
		<h4><span class="label label-danger"><s>Bug</s></span> Preset tools <small>Designer: Form builder - Filed: 29th 
			March 2014 - Closed: 1st June 2015</small></h4>
		
		<p>Editing a field added to a form using the preset tools enables the 
			wrong tool, a field which was added using the name tool should 
			select the text tool in edit mode, preset tools are only for 
			addition.</p>
			
		<p class="dev-note bg-success">Preset fields now act as standard fields 
			during addition, this not onlyu fixes the bug but also allowed me 
			to remove some duplicated code.</p>
