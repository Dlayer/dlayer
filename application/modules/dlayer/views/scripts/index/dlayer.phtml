    <h1>Dlayer</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Dlayer is a web site development tool.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>

    <p>Dlayer has two core goals, the first is to simplify web development, 
    the second is to provide full control over every element and attribute, 
    two goals that appear to be at odds with each other.</p>

    <p>1. Simplify web site development, a user should be able to build a 
    web site without writing a single line of html, css or code.<br />
    2. Provide full control over every element and attribute.</p>

    <p>It needs to be stated that Dlayer is not a clever templating system 
    with hundreds of pre-defined widgets, the user has real control over 
    every element and attribute.</p>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>

    <p>When it is done!</p>
