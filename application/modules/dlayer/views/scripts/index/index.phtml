		<h2>Project goal <small>Still a way off</small></h2>

		<p>I have long term goals for <a href="/">Dlayer.com</a> which far 
		exceed this concept version, this version just scratches the surface. 
		After many years of working on <a href="/">Dlayer.com</a> I've realised 
		that it will be better for my sanity to finish a concept version of 
		<a href="/">Dlayer.com</a> rather than try and complete the entire 
		project single handed.</p>

		<p>This project is being developed specifically as a proof of concept. 
		I'm trying where possible to write production quality code, I'm just 
		very aware that as a one man team developing this in my free time at my 
		own costs there is a limit to what I can do.</p>

		<p>Ideally this version will allow me to get external parties 
		interested in investment so that I can build a team and realise the 
		app that I imagined in 2008. As I am trying to showcase the concept 
		I'm using the best technology I can, this includes some of the new 
		input types in 
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html">HTML5</a>, as of writing 
		<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> 
		supports more of the new input types than any other browsers.</p>

		<p class="bg-info dev-note">If you are interested in seeing the 
		current specification for Dlayer.com please contact me at dean (at) 
		g3d-development (dot) com or via my 
		<a href="http://www.g3d-development.com">Development blog</a>.</p>
