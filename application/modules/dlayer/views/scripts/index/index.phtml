    	<h2>Project goal</h2>
    	
    	<p>I have long term goals for <a href="/">Dlayer</a> which far exceed 
    	this concept version, this version just scratches the surface.</p>
    	
    	<p>After many years of working on <a href="/">Dlayer</a> I've realised 
    	that it will be better for my sanity to finish a concept version of 
    	<a href="/">Dlayer</a> rather than try and complete the entire 
    	project single handed.</p>
    	
    	<p>This project is being developed specifically as a proof of concept, 
    	I'm aiming to write production quality code, I'm just very aware that 
    	I'm a one man team and am developing <a href="/">Dlayer</a> in my 
    	free time at my own cost.</p>
    	
    	<p>Ideally this version will allow me to get external parties 
    	interested in investment so that I can build a team and realise the 
    	<a href="/">Dlayer</a> that I imagined in 2008.</p>
    	
    	<p>As I am trying to showcase the concept I'm using the best 
    	technology I can, this includes the new input types of 
    	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html">HTML5</a>, as of 
    	writing 
    	<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> 
    	supports more of the new input types than any other browsers.</p>
    	
    	<p class="note">If you are interested in seeing the full current 
    	specification for Dlayer please contact me at dean (at) 
    	g3d-development (dot) com or via my 
    	<a href="http://www.g3d-development.com">blog</a>.</p>
