		<h1>Development plan <small>Plan of attack</small></h1>
		
		<p>The development plan for Dlayer exists in my head, the 
			specifications, OneNote and all over the white board in my man 
			cave, it is structured towards getting Dlayer into a position 
			where a user will be able to create a simple multi-page web site 
			with minor dynamic functionality. As soon as I have added enough 
			functionality to the Template designer, Content manager, Form 
			builder and Web site manager to achieve this goal I will dedicate 
			my time towards filling out the Content manager and Form 
			builder.</p>
		
		<p class="dev-note bg-info">This is a rolling list of the features 
			in my short term to do list, it will be updated periodically as 
			features are completed, Iâ€™m not going to detail my long term 
			development plans.</p>
		
		<p>The development of the Widget designer will always lag behind 
			the other designers, the Widget designer is an incredibly 
			complicated system because in addition to allowing dynamic 
			functionality it is in effect an amalgamation of all the 
			other designers.</p>
