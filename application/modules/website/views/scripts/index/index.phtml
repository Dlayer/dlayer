		<h1>Web site manager 
			<small>Content page relationship and management</small></h1>

		<h3>Welcome to the Web site manager</h3>

		<p>Within the Web site manager you define the relationships between 
			all your content pages to create the structure of your web 
			site.</p>
		
		<p>When a new content page is created it will initially be placed in 
			the unassigned pages bucket, from there you can assign its parent 
			and control its relationship with its siblings.</p>
		
		<p class="dev-note bg-info">The Web site manager is currently only a 
			preview, Iâ€™m still trying to work on something approaching the 
			final design. I need to develop the Template designer, Content 
			manager, Form builder and Widget designer further before 
			developing the Web site manager. This preview is here to give 
			you an idea of how the Web site manager could look and work.</p>
