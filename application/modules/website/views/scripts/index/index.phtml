    <h2>Web site: <?php echo $this->escape($this->site['name']); ?></h2>
    
    <p>Using the Web site manager you define the relationships between your 
    content pages, this builds your site map.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to defining the site structure you can also manage any site 
    level data that can be used by widgets, an exmaple being the pages and 
    titles used by a meni widget.</p>
    
    <p class="dev">The Web site manager is currently just a preview, I'm 
    still working on the design and functionality, this just gives an idea 
    of how it is intended to work.</p>
